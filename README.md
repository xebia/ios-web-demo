============

This is a simple universal iOS app for giving demonstrations of mobile web based application on a real device. It allows you to create some simple bookmarks to the web sites you want to demo. During the demo, the app will display touches (using the Touchpose framework). This will allow people to see where you touch when connected to a projector or other external display device.
